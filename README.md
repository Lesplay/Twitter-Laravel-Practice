# Twitter-Laravel-Practice
A Laravel learning project

Done in less than 10 hours, learning basics of Laravel. Had a blast.

Front-end leaves a lot to be desired and should be updated at a later date.

Current functionalities:
  - User login / new user register (Laravel functionality)
  - Adding new tweets
  - Commenting on tweets
  - Checking another user's profile to see their tweets
  - Simple message system
